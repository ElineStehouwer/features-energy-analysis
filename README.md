# Measuring the energy overhead of computer language features
This repository contains the code used to do the measurements for my Bachelor Thesis. All the code run is on here together with the scripts that were executed on the server of the Software Energy Lab to obtain the energy measurements.  

The `measuring_*.sh` files are the scripts that were called to execute the compiled code and run the energy measurements. Keep in mind that these scripts were called from the GitLab CI/CD Software Energy Lab, so to actually execute these, you will need access to this environment.

The `Raw_data_collected.xlsx` file contains the raw data of the nine runs of the measurements that we did. 

The `Rosetta` folder contains all the code needed to run the different benchmarks.
